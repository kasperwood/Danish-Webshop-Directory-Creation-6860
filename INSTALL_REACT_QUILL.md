# Install React Quill for WYSIWYG Editor

## Install the package
Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install react-quill quill
```

The package is already listed in package.json, so if you run:

```bash
npm install
```

It will install all missing dependencies including React Quill.

## Verification
After installation, you should see both packages in your node_modules:
- react-quill
- quill (peer dependency)

The WYSIWYG editor will then work properly in the blog manager.
